# julesvanrie.github.io

This is the repo for my (to be) personal website.

The site is going to be static and hosted on https://julesvanrie.github.io using GitHub pages.

For now it just says *Hello World* because it's still in its infancy, and as for any piece of code, these are the only words it has learned so far.
